			<h3> ABSTRACT </h3>
		</div>	
		
		<div class="abstract">
			<p>The world is in a crisis, currently dealing with a global pandemic in the form of COVID 19. The spread of COVID 19 in the whole world has put humanity at risk. The resources of some largest economies are stressed out by the large infectivity and transmissibility of this disease. The growing number of cases has caused stress on administration and health professionals, so some prediction methods would be required to predict the numbers of cases and factors that cause an increase in cases. So we aim to use a predictive model to analyze the historical data and also predict the future case. For prediction, we use regression and time series models based on time series data. The increase in cases is due to the temperature change. Temperature changes with seasons. So COVID 19 is going up or down depending on different factors. This model has done an exploratory analysis of data and predicts the number of confirmed cases. In this project, we analyzed various methods for the prediction of COVID cases and compared the results so the best fit model with higher accuracy is used for prediction. So this project presents the prediction of the number of cases and factors that are suitable for an increase in COVID 19 cases so that it will help in providing future safety to the people all over the world and control the spread of the pandemic. </p>

			<h3> INTRODUCTION </h3>
			
		</div>
		
		<div class="Introduction">
			<p>The 2019 Coronavirus pandemic, also known as COVID-19, is a contemporary occurrence that necessitates data collection, compilation, modelling, and forecasting in order to fully comprehend the pandemic's consequences. Many organisations were collecting the necessary COVID-19 data at the start of the pandemic. These organisations, which included hospitals, state and national health authorities, universities, and other research groups, have been collecting data since the pandemic began and have been sharing it with other organisations on a regular basis. The COVID-19 pandemic poses a significant challenge to governments, citizens, and the health-care industry because the disease's transmission is influenced by numerous elements, both known and unknown.

As additional data becomes available, modelling methods can be used to discover critical data and utilise it to forecast or confirm ideas that might help health and government institutions plan for the pandemic's hazards. The project involves numerous variables that can be gathered over time, such as location, temperature, and so on. As a result, we'll have multivariable time series data to work with. We will also cleanse, standardize, synchronize, and synthesize the data in a homogeneous way as we get more data from a variety of sources to construct a workable model. Finally, the project's purpose is to model the data in order to provide real-time analysis based on an accurate model.</p>

			<h3> BACKGROUND AND MOTIVATION </h3>
		</div>
		<div class="bgp">
			<p>In the aftermath of COVID-19, it has become considerably more challenging and crucial, since cases have increased dramatically. It is critical to evaluate what the future holds and what actions everyone can take. Forecasting cases can help guide public health decision-making by projecting the likely effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in the next weeks. Understanding the causes that cause the increase in COVID-19 can also help people better comprehend the triggers. They can also avoid areas where there is a risk of transmission.
		</div>
  In the subject of COVID-19 prediction, there is a lot of research going on. In our study, we want to forecast the number of cases and the factors that influence the number of cases in the future. </p>

			<p>Dataset Description:

 

Datasets used and their selected features: This project utilizes four distinct data sets focused on COVID-19 confirmed cases, deaths, recovered cases, global temperatures.

 

covid_19_clean_complete: Province, Country, Lat , LONG, Confirmed, Deaths, Recovered Time_series_covid_19_confirmed_US:Province,Country, No_of_Confirmed_cases_by_date Time_series_covid_19_Deaths_US: Province,Country,No_of_Deaths_cases_by_date Time_series_covid_19_Recovered: Province,Country,No_of_Recoevred_cases_by_date GlobalTemprature: LandAverageTemperature, LandAverageTemperatureUncertainty

 

Data Cleaning:

 

To clean our varied data sets, we performed multiple procedures. To make our data more compatible with various sorts of data mining tools, we made some basic initial changes such as standardizing, capitalizing, and replacing spaces with underscores. The dataset 'covid 19 clean complete', which is the largest, received a lot more cleaning effort. Using the excel VLOOKUP tool, we separated the temperature dataset into various datasets based on city, state, and nation, which will aid us in developing better visualizations in the future using matplotlib.

 

Several attributes in this dataset had missing values. We experienced difficulty recovering missing values when dealing with missing values. As a result, we used the built-in R function geopy() to treat missing characteristics (latitude and longitude) in the dataset with the help of 'WHO Region,' which is vital data for our project aim. In terms of other characteristics, we

 

Because the dataset already has 11,000+ rows, we opted to discard the rows with missing values. We imported the data into MySQL and utilized queries and functions to get all non-empty rows. We removed columns that were no longer needed and would be unused data as part of the cleaning process. To remove the columns from the entire dataset - 'time series covid 19,' we utilized Python's drop() function.
